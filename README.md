# Distributed-building-identification
Identify building thermodynamic models in a distributed manner.

# Requirements
The repository contents was created using following software:
 * Matlab R2020a
 * EnergyPlus 9.1.0

# Features
The repository contains a Matlab source code with a distributed building identification algorithm and one demo example.
The algorithm is thoroughly described in the article: __Distributed agent-based building grey-box model identification__, which is going to be published in the __Control Engineering Practice__ journal.
Contents of the repository (folders):
* code: OOP classes and other functions representing the algorithm.
* demo: A demo example.
** EnergyPlus_model: A folder with a Simulink model which runs EnergyPlus software in the background.
** __demo_DID_EP.mlx__: A LIVE SCRIPT WITH A DESCRIBED DEMO EXAMPLE.
